# city-match
According to Office of National Statistics, the number of migrants in the UK has reached a record level. 500,000 people move to the UK from overseas while 2,500,000 people move domestically within the UK. Although London is the principal destination, studies show that it is also the city where people feel less satisfied about their well-being. CityMatch emerges to help people find a city to live, using both reliable open data and personality questionnaires.

Discover the city you want to live in.
